# Functions-of-Loops
# AIM:
To Study and Implement Loops in C++
# Introduction:
Loops are control structures that enable the repetition of a set of instructions until a specific condition is met. They help avoid repetitive coding by automating repeated execution of code blocks.

# Types of Loops in C++
# for loop

# while loop

# do-while loop

# 1. for loop
Used when the number of repetitions is known before the loop starts.

Consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and update.

The loop starts by initializing a counter or variable.

Before each iteration, the condition is checked; if true, the loop body executes.

After each execution, the counter is updated (usually incremented or decremented).

The loop stops when the condition becomes false.

# 2. while loop
Used when the number of iterations is not known in advance.

The condition is checked before the loop executes each time.

If the condition is true, the loop body runs.

After the loop body runs, the condition is checked again.

The loop continues as long as the condition remains true.

If the condition is false initially, the loop body may never execute.

# 3. do-while loop
Similar to the while loop, but guarantees that the loop body executes at least once.

The loop body executes first, then the condition is checked.

If the condition is true, the loop repeats; otherwise, it stops.

Useful when you want to execute a loop body before checking a condition.
